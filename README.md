# legal_doc_reader

Legal Document Reader is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload legal or government documents (in PDF format) and interact with them using natural language. Powered by LangChain, FAISS, and local or cloud LLMs (like OpenAI or Ollama), the app intelligently processes large documents, splits them into chunks, generates embeddings, and enables question-answering â€” all through a user-friendly web interface.
